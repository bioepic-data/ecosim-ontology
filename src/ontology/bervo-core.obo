Spring leafout refers to the sprouting and growth of new leaves in plants during the spring season, while dehardening refers to the process by which plants transition from a dormant, hardened state to an active, growing state. The mobilization of nonstructural carbon refers to the utilization and movement of stored carbon reserves within the vegetation for the purpose of new growth and development during this period. This parameter tracks the accumulation and release of nonstructural carbon during leafout and dehardening, providing information on the timing and intensity of this process in Earth system models."

The concentration of nodule nonstructural C can be an important parameter in earth systems models as it can influence plant growth, nitrogen fixation rates, and carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems."

The concentration of these elements in the root layer can influence various processes, including nutrient uptake, plant growth, and carbon cycling within the ecosystem. This parameter is relevant for earth system modeling as it provides insights into the carbon dynamics and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems." []

Thinning can be done manually or through natural processes such as competition, predation, or disease. The purpose of thinning plant populations in earth systems modeling is to simulate realistic vegetation dynamics, including changes in species composition, productivity, and ecosystem functioning."
